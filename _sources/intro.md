# The AV blog

This blog is about experiments, walkthroughs, patterns and fun stuff around statistics and deep learning.
The goal is to learn, provoke thoughts and have fun!

## JAX Recipe series

Have you ever considered using deep learning frameworks like PyTorch or JAX for statistics?

[JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a powerful Python library facilitating the use of automatic differentiation, parallelism, and Just-In-Time compilation to CPU, TPU and GPU. All those features make it a library of choice for machine learning, but also more traditional statistics.

The following articles regroup recipes of increasing difficulty leveraging JAX for statistical analysis. We will demonstrate how JAX features can speed up inference and reduce time-to-market for your models.
